# Exploring AV-HuBERT for Automatic Lip-Reading: A Synthetic Dataset Analysis

This repository explores the implementation of the pre-trained AV-HuBERT model for automatic lip-reading, focusing on a synthetic dataset constructed from selected movie quotes. The goal is to assess the model's performance across predetermined metrics and identify potential areas for enhancement. Through this analysis, the effectiveness of the AV-HuBERT model in the context of lip-reading can be evaluated and refined.
